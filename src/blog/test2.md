Virgil was tired. Overall, his life had been quite good. He had raised 2 children, and even had a couple of grandchildren. He had learnt Anishnawbe from his uncle, and passed it along to the next generation, as well as the stories his grandmother used to tell him. He was ready to go out peacefully in a beautiful alcove in the middle of a forest, and have his legacy live on. Unfortunately, that was not to be, Virgil thought as he looked out of the 3rd story window of the giant concrete monstrosity he was doomed to spend his last moments in. He had become so accustomed to the various beeps and boops of the live support machines that he had forgotten what silence sounded like. He surveyed the concrete jungle that was Otter Lake reserve. Compared to the big cities, this was nothing, but it was still a sizable deviation from the reserve he had grown up with. Then, something caught his eye. Out in the distance, he could see a small area of green. This was the protected zone, an area of land that could not be built upon due to archaeological evidence. The memory made him smile. This world really did need some more magic.

Somewhere, far away, a man was preparing his greatest prank yet. He made a hand signal, and watched as a racoon on a far away building signaled back. Once, he and racoons had been mortal enemies, but when the super charged urbanization of the 2060s hit, they realized they had a common enemy. He watched as the racoon dropped a handful of seeds into the nearest concrete mixer. All the stress of construction had made him dream of trees growing out of monstrous skyscrapers, and things couldn’t have worked out better. As the racoon came leaping towards him, he realized there was something he had to do. 

Evelyn was sitting on her phone, debating whether or not to call her grandfather. She felt like she should, but she knew that it would just end up being an awkward experience for her. She knew her grandfather was dying. Everyone did. But what was she meant to say to him? She thought that it would be easier in person, but her grandfather’s health was so frail no one was allowed to go and see him. Her pondering was cut short, however, when she heard an unusual sound. It sounded like the engine of a car, though the sound was unfiltered and raw. She looked out just in time to see an Indiginous man, riding what looked to be a machine from hundreds of years ago, shoot past her window. He was riding towards the hospital.
    
The hospital’s security system flagged something on one of the many motion sensors around the building, and a probe drone was sent to look. When it arrived, it saw, to its surprise, a human. The human seemed to be trying to enter the building. This was odd. The only humans who entered the building were patients, and they entered exclusively through automated ambulances. A human hadn’t entered, or even attempted to enter, any other way for over 30 years. Yet now one was. At first, the human tried the maintenance hatch, but to no avail. Then, the human did something even more odd. They drove off, then returned with a couple of slabs of material. They then placed these slabs in the shape of a triangle based prism.  This was exceedingly odd. Then, to the drone’s surprise, the human drove over the triangular prism, and glided through the air for a few thousand milliseconds, before smashing straight through the window. The drone stared for a few seconds, then promptly fell out of the air after suffering a “segmentation fault”. 
    
Evelyn had finally found the courage to call her grandfather. She opened up her phone, clicked on “Virgil Second,” and waited. The call rang for a few seconds, then connected, and she saw something that surprised her. Inside the hospital, where only patients were meant to go, there was another man. Her grandfather and this man were chatting, like long lost friends finally reuniting. The man looked to be about 6” 4’, and she thought he was probably Anishnawbe. That thought was confirmed when she increased the volume, and heard that they were conversing in perfect Anishnawbe. Evelyn was far from fluent in Anishnawbe, but she could just about make out the gist of what they were saying. They seemed to be discussing the protected zone, the state of urbanization and, for some reason, racoons? However, the pondering was cut short when the man suddenly turned around and stared right at her.
    
“Who is this?” he asked, in perfect English.
    
Before Evelyn could reply, Virgil cut in. “That’s my granddaughter. As my grandmother would say, she could certainly use some magic”

“I see,” the man replied.
    
“Just promise me you won’t get up to any of the antics you did with Maggie and Lillian”
    
The man laughed. “If you insist”
    
Suddenly, the call disconnected. Evelyn had so many questions. Who was that man? Why was he talking to her grandfather? What did he mean by magic? No matter the answers, Evelyn had a feeling her life was about to be shaken up. And maybe that was a good thing.

Notes:
 - At first, very frustrating
